Background
::::::::::

Genebook is a resource for collaborative genomics research and is meant to allow a group of researchers to access their data in a simple and effective way. As a biological database system and user interface, Genebook can handle reference genome sequences and accompanying structural annotations, functional annotations, orthogroup information and expression data. Available information can be manually curated in a safe manner since all changes are tracked in a version history system.

This is an example_ of Genebook in action.
